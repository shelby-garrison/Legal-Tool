Overruling precedent \\nthat took that auth ority away from the people, the Court returned the issue of \\n“regulating or prohibiting abortion” to “the citizens of each State.” Ibid.  States may \\nthus pursue their “legitimate interests” in protecting unborn life, women’s health, \\nand the medical profession’s integrity by regulating or restricting abortion.

      "1. **Multiple State Support**: The case has the support of numerous state attorneys general, indicating a broad-based opposition to the FDA's actions (Page 6, Lines 19-24).\n",
      "2. **Public Interest and Equities**: The conclusion states that the public interest and equities support relief against the FDA's actions, suggesting a strong argument in favor of the plaintiffs (Page 6, Line 18).\n",
      "3. **Legal Precedent**: The case cites Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which could imply a significant legal precedent supporting the plaintiffs' argument (Page 24, Line ii, citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization).\n",
      "4. **Federal Overreach**: The involvement of state attorneys general may imply an argument against federal overreach by the FDA, though this is not explicitly stated (Page 6, Lines 19-24).\n",
      "5. **Constitutional Concerns**: The citation of cases like Gonzales v. Oregon and Hillsborough Cnty., Fla. v. Automated Med. Laboratories, Inc., may suggest constitutional concerns with the FDA's actions (Page 24, Line ii, citing Gonzales v. Oregon and Hillsborough Cnty., Fla. v. Automated Med. Laboratories, Inc.).\n",
      "\n",
      "### Arguments Against the Case (In Support of FDA's Actions)\n",
      "1. **FDA's Regulatory Authority**: The FDA has the regulatory authority to implement Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, which could support their actions in this case (Page 5).\n",
      "2. **Lack of Explicit Constitutional Violation**: There is no explicit mention of a constitutional violation by the FDA, which could weaken the plaintiffs' argument (No direct citation, implied from the lack of explicit mention).\n",
      "3. **Precedent for Federal Regulation**: Cases like Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts may support the FDA's regulatory actions, suggesting federal authority over certain health-related matters (Page 24, Line ii, citing Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Massachusetts).\n",
      "4. **State vs. Federal Jurisdiction**: The case of Maine v. Taylor could imply issues with state versus federal jurisdiction, potentially complicating the plaintiffs' argument (Page 24, Line ii, citing Maine v. Taylor).\n",
      "5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The citation of Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. might suggest the importance of regulatory compliance, which the FDA could argue they are upholding (Page 24, Line ii, citing Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp.).\n",
